## Introduction

Terraform is tool developed by Hashicorp which is used for automated deployment of infrastructure across multiple providers in public and private cloud. It is a must have tool in order to fully benefit from Infrastructure as Code concepts.

### Infrastructure as Code

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is to provision an infrastructure through use of software to achieve consistent and predictable environment.

There are some principles of IaC such as:
- Infrastructure is defined as code (yaml, json, hashicorp dsl)
- Code is stored in VCS
- Infrastructure definition can be imperative or declarative (prefered way)
